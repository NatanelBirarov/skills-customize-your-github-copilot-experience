# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. You will create endpoints, handle requests, and return JSON responses.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: Create a Simple FastAPI Application

#### Description
Set up a FastAPI project and create a basic API with at least two endpoints (e.g., `/hello` and `/info`).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Use FastAPI to create a web server
- Implement at least two GET endpoints
- Return JSON responses for each endpoint

### 🛠️ Task 2: Add Data Handling and POST Endpoint

#### Description
Extend your API to accept and process data using a POST request. Store submitted data in a Python list or dictionary.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Add a POST endpoint to accept JSON data
- Store received data in memory (list or dict)
- Provide a GET endpoint to retrieve all stored data

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand REST API concepts
- Practice using FastAPI for web development
- Learn to handle GET and POST requests

**Encouragement:**
Experiment with more endpoints, error handling, and data validation. Have fun building your first API!
